      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Flight software is becoming increasingly complex and
        unyielding as mission profiles and spacecraft become more sophisticated. We live
        in an age where many full or partial mission failures are caused by
        faulty software<a href="#NasaSat">[1]</a>. To improve the reliability and performance of
        future space flight software, we advocate for the adoption of
        Lingua Franca (LF), a programming model for deterministic, concurrent, and
        real-time Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). We also propose the use of PretVM, an execution backend for LF
        capable of implementing verifiable real-time behavior and optimizations. We will use
        these two concepts to develop a controller for an attitude control system.
      </p>

      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        Lingua Franca is a polyglot coordination language that offers
        deterministic concurrency and timing semantics<a href="#Lohstroh2019">[2]</a>. With this
        programming model, the programmer no longer has to worry about race conditions
        and other concurrency problems and can focus on the application logic. LF also removes
        the gap between "model" and "code" by allowing the
        same LF code to run both in simulation and on the real hardware.
        It's known that a subset of LF programs that are driven by timers can be compiled
        down to quasi-static schedules that can be executed on PretVM.
        PretVM<a href="#PretVM">[3]</a> is a register-based virtual machine built to
        fascilitate the scheduling and timing of concurrent tasks. Its virtual
        instruction set contains standard instructions such as <em>ADD</em> and <em>BEQ</em>
        borrowed from RISC-V. The PretVM instruction set also includes timing
        instructions, such as <em>DU</em> (delay until) and <em>WU</em> (wait until), which are inspired
        by PRET Machines<a href="#PretVM">[3]</a>.
        PretVM can be used as an execution backend for LF. External
        tools, include the Edge Generation Scheduler<a href="#EGS">[4]</a> and Mocasin<a href="#mocasin">[5]</a>, can
        be used to guide the generation of quasi-static schedules.
      </p>

      <h3>Contribution</h3>
      <p>
        In this presentation, we show that LF and PretVM
        have the potential to support future space flight software by developing a
        real-time controller for a three-axis reaction wheel system, which is used for
        attitude control of spacecraft. LF's determinism enables us to adopt
        test-driven development when developing the reaction wheel controller. For our
        reaction wheel system, we identify a real-time task set and a
        non-real-time task set. We show that, given that both sets are
        sufficiently decoupled, the real-time tasks can be scheduled on PretVM with
        verifiable real-time guarantees with the Edge Generation Scheduler. Similarly,
        with Mocasin, the non-real-time tasks can be scheduled optimally w.r.t. makespan
        and energy consumption. We further compare our implementation based on LF and
        PretVM with a reference implementation based on the Zephyr RTOS.

              We present Mocasin, an open-source rapid prototyping framework for researching, implementing and validating new algorithms and solutions in the field of mapping software to heterogeneous multi-cores. In contrast to the many existing tools that often specialize for a particular use-case, Mocasin is an open, flexible and generic research environment that abstracts over the approaches taken by other tools. Mocasin is designed to support a wide range of models of computation and input formats, implements manifold mapping strategies and provides an adjustable high-level simulator for performance estimation. This infrastructure serves as a flexible vehicle for exploring new approaches and as a blueprint for building customized tools. We highlight the key design aspects of Mocasin that enable its flexibility and illustrate its capabilities in a case-study showing how Mocasin can be used for building a customized tool for researching runtime mapping strategies in an LTE uplink receiver.
